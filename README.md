Algorithm pipeline:
Step1: the sphere falls down
Step2: when the sphere contacts the cloth, the speed of the sphere descends according to the Gaussian function
Step3: when the speed of the sphere is close to 0, we reverse the process above
Step4: when the sphere leaves the cloth, we consider the physical process again
